        <h2>Use Seattle Icons in your:</h2>
        <li>Civic applications</li>
        <li>Local blogs & other publications</li>
        <li>Presentations about local issues</li>
        <li>And wherever else you want!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>This project is just barely started! We held our first icon design-a-thon as part of CodeAcross Seattle, and upcoming events will expand the icon set. The goal is to create a resource of free-to-use icons that represent the city's neighborhoods, landmarks, issues, city services, & other important features.</p>

      <h2>How many icons exist so far?</h2>
      <p>One! You'll see it in the header above! It's the Space Needle.</p>
      <p>However! At our first icon design-a-thon, participants sketched ideas for icons that you can use as the basis for SVG icons. <a href="https://github.com/codeforseattle/seattle-icons/tree/gh-pages/icons/raw" target="_blank">Check out those sketches here</a>.</p>


      <h2>Who works on this?</h2>
      <p>Seattle Icons is a project started at <a href="http://codeforseattle.org/2014/03/05/codeacross-roundup" target="_blank">CodeAcross Seattle</a>, an event focused on open data and civic technology organized by <a href="http://codeforseattle.org" target="_blank">Code for Seattle</a>.</p>
      <p>Email Seth Vincent at svincent@codeforamerica.org if you're interested in getting involved!</p>

      <h2>How can I help?</h2>
      <p>Make an icon for your neighborhood, or for a landmark or issue in Seattle that interests you!</p>
      <p>Attend a Code for Seattle meetup to get involved as an organizer of Seattle Icons. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Seattle/" target="_blank">Join our meetup group</a> to get notifications about upcoming icon design-a-thons.</p>

      <p>You can also <a href="https://github.com/codeforseattle/seattle-icons/tree/gh-pages/icons/raw" target="_blank">fork this repository on GitHub</a> to help build the site, and to add icons (a simpler icon submission process is in the planning stages).</p>
